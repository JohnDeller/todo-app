# todo-app
This Go application (REST-Api) is a platform 
for creating a to-do list.
It implements: work with to-do lists, registration and authorization.

I used 
  github.com/gin-gonic/gin  - it's popular Go framework for creating web applications
  github.com/spf13/viper - it's library for parsing files 
  github.com/joho/godotenv - fot loads .env files
